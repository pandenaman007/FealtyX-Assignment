# Student Management API

This project is a simple REST API for managing students, built using Go and the Gorilla Mux router. The API allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records and integrates with the Ollama API to generate summaries for each student.

## Features

- **Create a Student**: Add a new student with their details.
- **Get All Students**: Retrieve a list of all students.
- **Get Student by ID**: Fetch details of a specific student using their ID.
- **Update a Student**: Modify details of an existing student.
- **Delete a Student**: Remove a student record from the system.
- **Get Student Summary**: Generate a summary of a student's details using Ollama's AI integration.

## Requirements

- Go (version 1.17 or higher)
- Ollama API (running locally)
